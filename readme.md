## Random tutorial on using basic python pandas libraries. 

Pandas library in python was used in writing the code in this file. To better understand how the methods were used, visit the pandas documentation of this modules [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/io.html)

The youtube link to the video of this tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg&t=464s) also. I highly recommend it.
